    Please specify the directory in the workspace you wish to scan. <br><br>
    Alternatively you can specify the URL of the file you wish to scan, BDBA
    will fetch the file from the given URL<br><br>

    For files in the workarea, if you wish to use an absolute path put '/' at the beginning of the path, this will cause
    the plugin to not try to find the folder from the build workspace. <i>Please notice that it is
    possible to upload massive amounts of files if this option is set to absolute path and
    the 'Include subdirectories' is enabled.</i><br><br>

    If there are 10 or more files to scan, the plugin will zip them before sending them.
    You can specify the name for the BDBA scan job in the field
    "Scan job name (used only for zip)".

    <p>
        Value can also be an environment variable containing the directory/URL, e.g $MY_SCAN_DIR or ${MY_SCAN_DIR}.
